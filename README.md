# Introduction
This work is highly inspired by https://paintschainer.preferred.tech/ and http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~ttwong/papers/colorize/colorize.pdf.  
The goal is to show how easy it is to train your own coloring network by using Pytorch, OpenCV, and the public Danbooru dataset.

# How to use it
1. Clone the repo, then run "python irodoru.py" in command line. Note that you might need to install CUDA and all the missing dependencies.
2. Use any browser to open "http://localhost:8080" and start playing!

# Installing the necessary dependencies
# Preparing the dataset
# Training the models
# Future work
